        Howdy and good day! I am Juan Duran and this is my story.<br><br>
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        Beginnings
      </h3>
      <p>
        I was the first of three children born to first-generation Americans and
        up until I five years old, we lived in the garage my father rented from my grandfather. All my life, 
        academics was heavily pushed by my family and drove me to graduate third in my class from Chester W. Nimitz High
        School and allowed me to  earn enough scholarships to afford college.

        <h3>
            College Part I
        </h3>
        
        <div class = "left">
          
            I entered Texas A&M's College of Engineering as an aspiring nuclear engineering student. I quickly involved myself
            with peer teaching, supplemental instruction, and personal tutoring for the freshmen engineering program 
            to both pay for college and give me a way to assist others in overcoming struggles I experienced in 
            previous courses. I very quickly rose to the senior ranks of the peer teachers and was promoted to the lead supplemental instructor
            for the program.

        I also had the opportunity to  participate with A&M's Nuclear Power Institute and work
        on a research project with NASA in hardware/software engineering role. It was through these experience that I discovered 
        my fascination with programing, design, and electronics, topics I had at this point been teaching students but
        not using in my major. I ultimately decided to switch into computer engineering starting my senior year and 
        began my next stage of life.

        </div>
      <p>
          It was in these next three years that I would involve myself with the Society of Women Engineers; it was through
          my many students I previously had taught inviting me to numerous events with a plethora of food. I made many lasting
          friendships and networked with many visiting speakers. In addition this, I decided to make use of the extra time I was spending in 
          college to minor in Cybersecurity and Mathematics. Finally, after a total of five and a half years, I completed my college
          adventure and could not be happier.

      <h3>
          Post-Graduation
      </h3>
      <p>
          I spent another five months continuing work at Texas A&M to assist the Academic Success Center 
          and the freshmen engineering program to cycle into the new course curriculum that was developed.
          During this time, I was active job hunting but to no avail. It was not until late in August that
          I was contacted by Talent Path and ultimately began my role as a junior full stack engineer in September.

              I met my wife in 5th grade and we later started dating sophomore year of high school. We both attended Texas A&M with her
              joining as a computer engineering major and graduating on time with honors. She was a major source for inspiration for me to ultimately change majors and she 
              supported me through my five and a half year ordeal there.

              In my free time I enjoy playing the Star Wars Roleplaying Game. I am my group's game master and for our most recent campaign
              we've had a consistent session every other week for the past three months. In addition to this, I also play Star Wars Armada,
              a  Star Wars tabletop game, with the local Houston area group every week. This has been a more recent hobby I've acquired
              and I'm aspiring to qualify for the international championships.
